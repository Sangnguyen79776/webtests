 you can use this source code folder
 or you can use phpwebproject folder in my repository 
 # Some noted about system:
1.PHPMailer folder is needed for you to install before coding receive automatically email<br>
2.uploads folder is a file to locate a pdf file when staff have posted idea with pdf file<br>
 3. You need to config your $mail->username if you want to test the receive automatically email function()<br>
and $mail->password when you have generated your app password in your real gmail you have assign<br>
You need to add SMTP Debug to your coding line when you create a new object for PHPMailer <br>
4. ideav is a file for staff when they have viewed all idea list<br>
